# What is GPGNet Fix #
GPGNetFix is GPGNet reverse engineered back to C# and fixed.
## Goal ##
The goal is to completely reverse engineer GPGNet, get it to compile cleanly, and then fix any and all bugs we can find, and possibly add some new shiny features.
## Piracy ##
Currently piracy and/or hacks are rather easy using tools as .NET Reflector and the Reflexil plugin, or even just as GPGNet plugins. It's highly unlikely that the source-code to GPGNetFix will make it any easier than it already is, and as such we feel that there's no need for any extra security on that matter.
## Notes ##
Only new code is under the MIT License, all existing GPGNet code is copyright by Gas Powered Games.
## Current state ##
Currently, the code compiles and most parts seem to work, but that's about it. No extra fixes or features yet. For normal users, there is no advantage yet to using this over the normal GPGNet. However, if you're a developer wanting to help, do drop me a message and start exploring :)
